The RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) approach is a customer segmentation technique used in supermarkets to analyze purchasing behavior. Recency (R) measures how recently a customer made a purchase, helping identify active and dormant customers. Frequency (F) tracks how often a customer shops, distinguishing between regular and occasional buyers. Monetary (M) represents the total spending, identifying high-value and low-value customers. Customers are scored on a scale for each metric and categorized into segments like Loyal Customers (frequent, high spenders), Potential Loyalists (new but active shoppers), At-Risk Customers (previously active but now inactive), and Lost Customers (haven't shopped in a long time). This segmentation enables targeted marketing, personalized promotions, and better customer retention strategies to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.
